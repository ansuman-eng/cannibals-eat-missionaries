AI to solve the famed Cannibal-Missionary problem

The Cannibal Missionary problem starts with three Cannibals and three Missionaries on one side of a river bank.
Their goal is to reach the other bank, all of them, using a boat which is intitially with them.
Boat can take 1 or 2 people.
Cannibal number can't outweigh the Missionary number on either bank or boat(on boat, they actually can't)
The solution was found using DFS Backtracking (I know, not very AI'ish, but I needed to present a PRIMITIVE
/BLIND search technique without any use of heuristics)
